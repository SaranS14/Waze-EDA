# <p style = "text-align: center;"> **Waze User Churned EDA** </p>

Waze's Operational Manager asked the Data Analysis team to construct some exploratory data analysis on the following data set to see whether or not they can discover some reasons why users are churning. From the EDA, the Senior Data Analyst will then determine whether or not the team should construct a model to predict whether or not users will churn or not churn. The objective of this specific project is to create visualizations and statistics showing relationships and patterns between the variables. 

Below are the variables within the data set and their descriptions. 
| Variable      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| label      | A label indicating whether a user churned or retained anytime within the month |
| sessions   | Number of times a user opened the app during the month |
| drives | Number of times user drove at least 1km during the month |
| device | The type of device the user starts the sessions with |
| total_sessions | A model estimate of the userâ€™s total number of sessions since onboarding |
| n_days_after_onboarding | Number of days since user signed up for the app |
| total_navigation_fav1 | Total number of times user navigated to their #1 favourite destination |
| total_navigation_fav2 | Total number of times user navigated to their #2 favourite destination | 
| driven_km_drives | Total kms driven during the month |
| duration_minutes_drives | Total number of minutes user drove during the month |
| activity_days | Total number of days user opens the app during the month |
| driving_days | Total number of days user drives at least 1km during the month |

(This project is focused on EDA (exploratory data analysis). I constructed several graphs and statistics to detail relationships 
between variables to get a better understanding on why users may have churned from using the Waze navigation app.)
